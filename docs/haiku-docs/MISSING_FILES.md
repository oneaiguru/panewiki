# Outstanding Documents

| Path | Expected length | Notes |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| `home-detail` | ~100 lines (15 min read) | Full context companion to `home`; should include Opus summary + Haiku detail, navigation links, and cost transparency. |
| `three-pillars/pillar-1/400px-width-math` | ~60 lines (10 min read) | Deep dive on readability research, includes citations + derivations supporting the 400px constraint. |

These files are referenced throughout the system (INDEX, Pillar 1 detail, System reference). Generate them next to keep navigation links intact.
