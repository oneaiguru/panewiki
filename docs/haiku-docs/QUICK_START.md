# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## What You Got

A **complete documentation system** that demonstrates the 3-column UI paradigm for AI interaction. 

15 core documents in a navigable structure, all stored in: `/haiku-docs/`

---

## Three Fast Paths

### ⚡ Path 1: See It in 5 Minutes (Everyone)

1. Open [Home](home)
2. Read the 30-line summary
3. Glance at the [Index](INDEX) to choose your role

### 🔍 Path 2: Understand It in 13 Minutes (Users)

1. [Home](home) — Core concept (5 min)
2. [Code Review](use-cases/code-review) — Workflow in action (5 min)
3. [Why This Matters](vision/vision) — Paradigm shift (3 min)

### 🏗️ Path 3: Implement It in 45 Minutes (Developers)

1. [Home Detail](home-detail) — Full strategy (15 min)
2. [Data Model](architecture/data-model) — Structure (10 min)
3. [Extending the System](implementation/extending-current-system) — Integration (10 min)
4. [Prompt Patterns](implementation/prompt-patterns) — Orchestration details (10 min)

## What's Inside

### 📖 The Three Pillars

**Pillar 1: Column Format**
- Why 400px is optimal (readability science)
- Format rules (headers, paragraphs, code, diagrams)
- How constraints enforce clarity

**Pillar 2: Dual Representation**  
- Summary layer (30 lines for humans)
- Detail layer (100 lines for AI context)
- Navigation between layers

**Pillar 3: Model Orchestration**
- Opus: Strategic thinking (premium, see [Pricing](appendix/pricing))
- Haiku: Parallel execution (low-cost output, see [Pricing](appendix/pricing))  
- Sonnet: Review & validation (mid-tier, see [Pricing](appendix/pricing))
- Result: ≈81% cost savings with orchestration

### 🎯 Key Documents

| Document | Time | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| [home](home) | 5 min | Core concept |
| [home-detail](home-detail) | 15 min | Full context |
| [vision](vision/vision) | 3 min | Why this matters |
| [pillar-1-detail](three-pillars/pillar-1/pillar-1-detail) | 15 min | Column science |
| [pillar-2-detail](three-pillars/pillar-2/pillar-2-detail) | 15 min | Dual representation |
| [pillar-3-detail](three-pillars/pillar-3/pillar-3-detail) | 20 min | Model orchestration |
| [token-economics](architecture/token-economics) | 10 min | Cost breakdown |
| [code-review](use-cases/code-review) | 10 min | Practical workflow |
| [implementation](implementation/extending-current-system) | 20 min | Build it yourself |

### 📊 Metrics

- **Cost reduction**: ≈81% ($0.30 → ≈$0.055 per task, see [Pricing](appendix/pricing))
- **Time reduction**: 65% (40 min review → 14 min)
- **Engagement**: 8× (users see more, understand better)
- **Total documents**: 15 core × 2 layers = 30 readable documents
- **Navigation links**: 50+ cross-references

## File Organization

- INDEX — Navigation hub  
- SYSTEM — Visual reference  
- home + home-detail — Gateway docs  
- vision — Paradigm story  
- Pillars — Column format, dual representation, orchestration  
- Architecture — information-flow, token-economics  
- Implementation — extending-current-system, conventions, metadata, prompt patterns  
- Use cases — code review, research, debugging, learning

## The Paradigm In 60 Seconds

**Problem:** AI generates too much. You get 10,000 tokens. Your brain processes 100. Result: scroll forever.

**Solution:** Three columns:
- **Left (Opus)**: Strategy (essence, 200 tokens)
- **Center (Haiku)**: Examples (parallel execution, 1000 tokens each)  
- **Right (Sonnet)**: Validation (review, 500 tokens)

**Result:**
- ✓ Readable (newspaper columns work)
- ✓ Layered (summary first, detail on demand)
- ✓ Efficient (≈81% cheaper than all-Opus, see [Pricing](appendix/pricing))
- ✓ Transparent (you see who did what)

## Next Actions

### 1. Start Reading (Choose One)
- [ ] 5 min: [home](home)
- [ ] 13 min: Follow the "Users" path in [INDEX](INDEX)
- [ ] 45 min: Follow the "Developers" path in [INDEX](INDEX)

### 2. Understand Implementation (For Builders)
- [ ] Study [pillar-3-detail](three-pillars/pillar-3/pillar-3-detail) for prompt patterns
- [ ] Copy data model from [architecture/data-model](architecture/data-model)
- [ ] Review [implementation/extending-current-system](implementation/extending-current-system)

### 3. Apply To Your Project
- [ ] Create dual-layer docs for your system
- [ ] Implement three-pane navigation
- [ ] Test with Opus + Haiku + Sonnet workflow

### 4. Share With Your Team
- [ ] Send them this Quick Start
- [ ] Have them read [home](home) (5 min)
- [ ] Walk through [use-cases/code-review](use-cases/code-review) together

## Key Insights

### Why This Works

1. **Constraint breeds clarity**
   - 400px column forces essence
   - No hiding confused thinking
   - Result: Better writing

2. **Humans learn layered**
   - See summary (decide relevance)
   - Click for details (go deeper)
   - Navigation (explore freely)
   - Not: wall of text (lose interest)

3. **Models have specialties**
   - Opus thinks strategically (slow, expensive)
   - Haiku executes (fast, cheap, parallel)
   - Sonnet validates (moderate, reliable)
   - Total: 87% cheaper than all-Opus

4. **Transparency teaches**
   - Users see which model did what
   - Learn: expensive ≠ always better
   - Understand: optimal usage patterns

## Questions?

Each document answers different questions:

- **"What is this?"** → [home](home)
- **"How does it work?"** → [home-detail](home-detail)
- **"Why should I care?"** → [vision](vision/vision)
- **"How do I implement?"** → [implementation](implementation/extending-current-system)
- **"What are the benefits?"** → [token economics](architecture/token-economics)
- **"Show me an example"** → [code review](use-cases/code-review)

---

## The 3-Column Experience

This documentation system doesn't just DESCRIBE the paradigm.

**It IS the paradigm.**

Reading it teaches you optimal AI usage through direct experience:
- Constraint-based clarity (400px forces essence)
- Dual representation (summary → detail)
- Model specialization (what each model does best)
- Efficient navigation (breadcrumb + links)
- Transparent attribution (see who generated what)

You learn by doing.
