# The 3-Column Interface for AI

## The Problem

Modern AI tools output too much. You get 10,000 tokens. Your brain processes 100. Result: scroll forever, lose context, ask again.

## The Solution

**Three columns. Three models. Three roles.**

```
┌─────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
│ Opus    │ Haiku   │ Sonnet  │
│ WHY     │ WHAT    │ VERIFY  │
└─────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
```

Read left (strategy). Click center (details). Check right (validation).

## Why This Works

- **Readable**: Newspaper columns are proven better than wide text
- **Layered**: Summary first, detail on demand (how humans learn)
- **Efficient**: Use cheap models for execution, expensive ones for thinking
- **Transparent**: See which AI did what, and why

## Three Core Ideas

**1. Dual Representation**
Everything has a short version (you read) and a long version (AI context). Navigation reveals layers.

**2. Column Format**
400px width forces essence. No filler. No fluff. Pure structure.

**3. Model Orchestration**
Opus thinks → Haiku illustrates (parallel) → Sonnet validates. Token-efficient, quality verified.
