# What's Broken: The Problem

## Information Overload

AI generates 10,000 tokens. You process 100. Result: 9,900 wasted tokens.

**Why scrolling doesn't work:**
- Users skim first 30 lines
- Decide if relevant
- Most never scroll to see full content
- Engagement drops 90% after first screen

## The Cognitive Mismatch

**AI Output:** Optimized for completeness
- Generate everything
- User will find what they need
- More is better

**Human Cognition:** Optimized for efficiency
- Process ~100 tokens at once
- Working memory: 4-7 items
- Need guidance: what matters?

**Result:** Fundamental mismatch between supply and demand.

## The Real Cost

- Time to find information: 20 minutes of scrolling
- User frustration: high
- Comprehension: low (~10%)
- Engagement: users give up

## Why Current Interfaces Fail

1. **No hierarchy:** Everything equally visible
2. **No guidance:** User must decide importance
3. **No layers:** Can't drill deeper selectively
4. **No transparency:** Which model did what?
