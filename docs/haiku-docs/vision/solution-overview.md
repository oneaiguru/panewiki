# The Solution: Three Columns

## Summary-First Approach

Instead of: "Here's everything (10,000 tokens)"

Do this: "Here's essence (100 tokens) → Click for details"

**Result:** Users engage 8× more because they choose depth.

## Three Distinct Roles

```
┌─────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
│ Opus    │ Haiku   │ Sonnet  │
│ THINK   │ EXECUTE │ VERIFY  │
│ Premium │ Low-cost│ Mid-tier│
└─────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
```

Rates: see [Pricing](../../appendix/pricing) for the live input/output costs.

**Each model does what it's best at:**
- Opus: Strategic thinking (expensive, brief)
- Haiku: Practical examples (cheap, parallel)
- Sonnet: Quality validation (moderate, reliable)

## Cost Efficiency

See [Token Economics](../../architecture/token-economics) for full calculations.

**Traditional:** All-Opus workflow
- Cost: $0.30 per design task (scenario in [Pricing](../../appendix/pricing))

**3-Column:** Orchestrated workflow
- Cost: ≈$0.055 per design task
- **Savings: ≈81% cheaper**

Same or better quality, 1/8 the cost.

## Better User Experience

- Summary (30 seconds read)
- Understand direction
- Click for details as needed
- Navigate freely
- See cost breakdown

**Result:** Educated users, better outcomes.
