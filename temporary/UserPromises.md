# User Promises Tracker

This file tracks explicit promises from the user so we can fulfill them without losing track.

- [Pending] Provide longer DesignDecisionsLog (full/hub) later for FINAL.
  - Note: We will avoid duplicating the Decision Log across folders. Keep a single canonical DesignDecisionsLog in FINAL; SUMMARIES will maintain connectivity via direct ADR links or a minimal pointer without duplicating content.
